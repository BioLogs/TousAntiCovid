# bin/ directory

Usually this directory wouldn't be included in a repo, but **it must exist** in order
to build the executable (see `src/Makefile`).

We have also included a script `gnu_parallel_call.sh`, which allows for fast conversion 
of `*.ppm` files to `*.gif`, to make "a movie" of the simulation's graphical output.
